# spatial-arbitrage
spatial arbitrage bot using python,

Search price differences at the different markets. For now only supporting GateIO and MXC

For now: just search the prices. I will add buy and sell options. Also i will add transfer coins between markets.

Test it with 1000usdt

Example: Buy XRP/USDT (1/0.70) from gateio sell at MXC XRP/USDT (1/0.8)

supporting coins : ['XRP','XLM'] *i will add more coins. Coins have to faster for transfer. Because prices can be change quickly.
